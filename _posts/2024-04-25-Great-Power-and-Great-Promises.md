In 2 Peter, the author reminds believers of their divine nature and calls them to remember that they are warned of the influence of false teachers in the times ahead. Peter states that God has given them all things necessary to live a godly life through the knowledge of Him and His precious and very great promises so that they may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption of the world.

Peter encourages believers to work out their salvation and provides a list of qualities they should strive for. These qualities include virtue, knowledge, self-control, steadfastness, godliness, brotherly affection, and love.
